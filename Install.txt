==== INSTALLING SNAP ON A NEW MACHINE ====
==========================================

This file is a guide on setting up the SNAP on a new server.

Clone the repository. If you are a new developer contributing to SNAP, you
should fork the repository from mcenek/SNAP, unless Dr. Cenek has told you
otherwise.

Simple setup:
  Install WAMP,MAMP, or LAMP.
  Install phpMyAdmin in the www/ directory
  Install SNAP in the www/ director
  Install CodeIgnighter in you snap Program

  download the production database
  Create your databases on your local machine
  
  
In repository, install Code Igniter. This basically means downloading the
latest version, unzipping it, and migrating its contents into the repository.
 - You may want to rename the application folder in the repository before you do
this, or, alternatively, do not migrate the application folder from the
Code Igniter download.
 - You should NOT replace the existing .gitignore in the
SNAP repo with the one from CI.
 - It is not necessary to migrate the user_guide directory, but it also won't
hurt anything, and may contain some useful resources.

If you renamed the application folder in the SNAP repo before moving the CI
contents, delete the default CI application folder, and rename the SNAP
application folder back to application.

At this point you must change some machine specific config files.
Go to application/config/ and you should see two _TEMPLATE files,
config and database.

Copy these files, and rename them - removing the _TEMPLATE from their names.
    config_TEMPLATE.php -> config.php

In your new config.php file, change the value for line:
    $config['base_url'] = "YOUR_BASE_URL";
to whatever your base url is. For running locally, this should just be:
    $config['base_url'] = "http://localhost/SNAP";
with SNAP replaced by whatever the path to the git repo is from your server
root.

In your database.php file, update the username and password fields to whatever
database account you want the site to use. If you haven't set up the mysql db
yet, do so now: There are lots of tutorials online for setting up a mysql db
locally. You'll also need an apache server set up, if you're on a linux machine,
follow a guide on setting up a LAMP Server, if you're on a mac, just use MAMP, and if you're on windows use WAMP.


                            
Unless I've forgotten something crucial (likely), as long as you have your
server and database running, you should be set up. Go to your base url to test.
